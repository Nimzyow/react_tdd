This project is an exercise in pure TDD.

What exactly does that mean? I usually use create-react-app to initially build a React application. Not this time though.

I am sticking to the principles of YAGNI (You ain't gonna need it). This means creating the React application from the ground up and yes, that will mean going through the hellish process of messing around with webpack to actually interact with the app on a browser.

As of this point, I have actually got the webpack to transpile the code to the browser and though it's nothing to really show off, I am very proud to have pulled this off. It's especially satisfying to have done this from scratch. No magic involved, I started from an empty repo and built up this application file by file, test by test.

This includes the following but not limited to:

1. installing jest
2. installing babel presets and plugins
3. enabling presets in .babelrc
4.
